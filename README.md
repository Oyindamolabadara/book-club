# BOOK SITTERS CLUB
BSC is a site that is targeted towards bringing  together a small group of young adults passionate about reading and talking about books in London, Uk. 
BSC will be useful for book lovers to see what book would be read monthly at the regular meet up venue and time. 
Users of this website would find information about BSC; About us, meeting time, venue and a contact form for further enquires.

# DESIGN
## COLOR SCHEME
![Color Scheme](assets/images/color-scheme.png)
The color schemes were gotten from [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) using the hero image to extract different color schemes that matched it. 
I used the color #f2f1dc for the  navbar  and footer to make the links visible and stand out. 
I used #f2dea0 for the background of the site.
I used #f2cb9b for the  form section to make it stand out from other contents. 

# WIREFRAME
The initial idea for this site was to be very simple and basic, but as I progressed with the design I decided to expand the design a bit more with other ideas.

  * Form validation requests the user to input the correct information in the input fields.
  * Avoids the user accidentally sending blank or incomplete forms.

# Existing Features

* Featured at the top of the page, the navigation shows the club name, BSC in the left corner. 
* The other navigation links are to the right: About us, Gallery and Contact us which links to different sections of the same page. 
* The navigation has a color that contrasts with the background.
* The navigation clearly tells the user the name of the club and website and makes the different sections of the information easy to find.

# SOLVED BUGS
* When I ran my code through W3C Validators, I was given an error message saying there was a bad value for the width on the video element. Expected a digit but saw percentage instead. This was fixed by removing the percentage and changing the value, i.e from 80% to 80.  
* I designed for the desktop version first, which gave me some issues whilst trying to make the site responsive, the images in the gallery section and the navbar specifically. I managed to fix this using the grid-template-column. 
* Another error message was given on the W3C Validators about the grid-template-columns. It said 1fr is not a gap value. This was fixed by changing 1fr to 25%. 
* After checking again, there were no further errors.
